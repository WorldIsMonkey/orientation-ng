# orientation-ng
Next generation orientation engine running in browsers.

The goal of this project is to port the long-existing (a.k.a. crappy) [Flash-based orientation engine](https://github.com/WorldIsMonkey/orientation-lts) to browsers in order to achieve maximum portability, maintainability and expandability using latest web technologies.

This project is restarted, Shouyu and Joe will work on it, maybe there will be another person.

## TODO
- [âˆš] Structure
- [ ] Multiple choice
- [ ] True or False

- [ ] Live score board `// same as above`

## API
A content delivery API is included in the [orientation-drupal](https://github.com/WorldIsMonkey/orientation-drupal) project.

we might construct a new version of these in the future.

To retrieve the JSON output of each question type, you can `GET` the following endpoints:
```
/jsonapi/node/multiple_choice
/jsonapi/node/short_answer
/jsonapi/node/true_or_false
/jsonapi/node/mosaic
/jsonapi/node/mask
/jsonapi/node/music
```
Note that for fields with uploaded files (e.g. image, audio, video), a second API call to the URL in `links.related` is needed to get the actual URL of the file.
